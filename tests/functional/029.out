Invalid parameter 4:4
To create erasure coded vdi, set -c x:y
  x(2,4,8,16)  - number of data strips
  y(1 to 15)   - number of parity strips
and meet the condition x > y
To create replicated vdi, set -c x
  x(0 < x <= 31) - number of replicated copies
Invalid parameter 4:5
To create erasure coded vdi, set -c x:y
  x(2,4,8,16)  - number of data strips
  y(1 to 15)   - number of parity strips

There are not enough nodes(23) to hold the copies(24)
Usage: dog vdi create [-P] [-c copies] [-a address] [-p port] [-h] [-r] [-v] <vdiname> <size>
Options:
  -P, --prealloc          preallocate all the data objects
  -c, --copies            specify the data redundancy level
  -a, --address           specify the daemon address (default: localhost)
  -p, --port              specify the daemon port
  -h, --help              display this help and exit
  -r, --raw               raw output mode: omit headers, separate fields with
                          single spaces and print all sizes in decimal bytes
  -v, --verbose           print more information than default
